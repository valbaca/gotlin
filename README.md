# gotlin

Structured concurrency
from [The Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io/) [code](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io/)
reimagined/reimplemented
in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) [coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)

`fun gotlin(go): kotlin`

**Why?**

Go's goroutines and Kotlin's coroutines have a lot in common (and only one letter different)!

While learning Kotlin I struggled a bit with understanding coroutines in a way that I didn't when learning goroutines.

When I learned about Kotlin's [`select`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/select-expression.html) I realized I could fully
re-apply my goroutine knowledge. I don't have a Kotlin coroutine book on my shelf, but I do have "The Go Programming
Language"

So, for my own self-elucidation **(and hopefully others as well!)** I began rewriting the examples in Kotlin.

I found Kotlin coroutines online quite lacking, so hopefully this helps improve that by proxy.

## Caveats

1. This is **NOT** production code. I don't do great error handling and the code is probably terrible.
2. I'm still new to Kotlin. I did this as a part of learning Kotlin. See point #1
3. Coroutines are available in Kotlin
   via [`kotlinx-coroutines-core`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/README.md#using-in-your-projects).
   Coroutines aren't a part of the core language like goroutines are in Go.
4. I first used [http4k](https://www.http4k.org/) as a substitute for [Go net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) for requests and server. Later on I started using [Ktor](https://ktor.io/)

Of course: if you've got suggestions, please create Pull Requests!

## Things I've learned

1. See the Coroutine extension pattern below
2. Kotlin's Channels throw exceptions if read from after close. Go's channels return zero-value.
3. Kotlin's `select` is implemented as a DSL and has some differences from Go's `select`:
    - If multiple cases are valid, Kotlin biases toward the first whereas Go will pick at random.
    - Kotlin's `select` doesn't have a `default`
4. Rather than using `object{}` which is akin to Go's `struct{}{}`, Kotlin can instead use `Unit` for channels that only process signals without any content.
5. Kotlin has `whileSelect` which replaces Go's `for { select {` infinite-loop pattern.

### Coroutine extension pattern

I learned this pattern from: [Kotlin Coroutines in Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3agLJQ6vt8). In-fact, that
talk directly inspired me to work on this.

```kotlin
import kotlin.coroutines.CoroutineContext

// Take a function...
fun fn() {
    /* do fn stuff */
}

// ...and simply change the first line to the following

fun CoroutineContext.fn() = launch {
    /* do fn stuff */
}

// ... and now you can call it within any coroutine scope and it will launch a coroutine


fun main() = runBlocking {
    fn() // now this is semi-equivalent to `go fn()` in Go
}
```
